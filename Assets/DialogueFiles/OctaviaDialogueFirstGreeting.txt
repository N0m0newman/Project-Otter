[OCTAVIA] Hello? What are you and What are you doing here? I’d suggest you leave before things get messy. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak) 
[OCTAVIA] I have your precious stone? Well tough luck, it’s mine now. Finders keepers and all that jazz. 
[OSLO] (Angry Squeak)
[OCTAVIA] How laughable. What can you do to stop me? You ‘re just a little creature throwing his toys out the pram, I’m a beast with more than enough experience to deal with you. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[OCTAVIA] I’m bored of you now. Stay still so I can dispose of you quickly, you little rat. I’ve taken a shine to your stone and I intend to keep it.
