[ABIGAIL] Hey Oslo! You really made it! I’m so glad your brothers didn’t give you any trouble. 
[OSLO] (Angry Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] Oh they did? What a couple of scoundrels! Don't worry about them any more, I’ll go sort them out!
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] You’ve got the statue too? That’s amazing! There should be a passage nearby that will take you straight back down to the Glacial Grotto! Good luck and I really hope I see you again someday!
[OSLO] (Happy squeak)
