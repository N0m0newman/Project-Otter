[FREDDIE] Hello There! That weather was crazy don’t you think? *ribbit*
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[FREDDIE] ‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen you around here before. *ribbit* My name is Freddie.
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[FREDDIE] Oslo eh? Pretty cool name there. So where are you headed? *ribbit*
[OSLO] (Curious squeak)
[FREDDIE] Trying to find a soul stone? *ribbit* Well I wish you luck, stones are heavy so it’s probably fallen deeper. 
[OSLO] (Sad squeak)
[FREDDIE] Aw, don’t be sad, It’s not all bad. *ribbit* In fact it’s lucky you met me today. 
[OSLO] (Confused Squeak)
[FREDDIE] I’m one of the only creatures up here who knows the way to go down. *ribbit*
[OSLO] (Curious Squeak)
[FREDDIE] I mean I could tell you but it gets dangerous down there. *ribbit* Do you think you’re ready to face the depths?
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[FREDDIE] You definitely sound ready. Who am I to stop you? *ribbit* The answer to the door that leads down further can be found in the answer to this simple riddle. 
[OSLO] (Excited squeak)
[FREDDIE] Which fish costs the most? Come back to me with an answer and I’ll open the door for you. *ribbit* If you need any help, remember to look far and wide and the answer will be in plain sight. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[FREDDIE] Oh, before you go, I’m hoping you could do me a favour. *ribbit*. I’ve been saving some snacks for a while but the storm swept them all away and now I’m kind of hungry. If you happen to come across a jar of flies and return them to me, I’ll make it worth your while. *ribbit*. 
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
