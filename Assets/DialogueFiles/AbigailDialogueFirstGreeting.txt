[ABIGAIL] Hiya little buddy! You’re cute but I’ve never seen you around here before. You new?
[OSLO] (Curious Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] Oh! I see. Me? I’m Abigail. My friends call me Abby! It's really nice to meet you Oslo! We don’t see a lot of your kind around here. So what brings you here?
[OSLO] (Sad Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] Oh really? You lost your soul stone? And now you’re trying to find some kind of musical statue? That kinda sounds familiar, you know? 
[OSLO] (Curious Squeak) 
[ABIGAIL] Oh! I know! My brothers might have what you’re looking for down in their lair! 
[OSLO] (Alarmed Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] Oh I wouldn’t worry, they aren’t too bad. I’d just call them…playful? You can find them by going through a pipe nearby but be careful. I swear it’s like a maze down there! I can never find my way through so I do wish you all the luck!
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] Hey Oslo! Before you go. If you happen to find those brothers of mine then would you mind doing me a small favour? They took my toothbrush and they’re refusing to give it back. I’d be able to give you something to help you go further if you do! 
[OSLO] (Happy squeak)
