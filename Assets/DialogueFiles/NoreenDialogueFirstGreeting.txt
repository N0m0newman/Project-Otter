[NOREEN] Hello. How are you doing today? *click* I’ve never seen a creature like you swim this far but I do find it quite admirable. What brings you out this way?
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[NOREEN] I see, that is quite a story to tell isn’t it. My name is Noreen, *click* what is yours may I ask?
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[NOREEN] Oslo? What a handsome name for such a quaint creature. I say, to have come this far and remain so optimistic is a trait that is rare to see these days. *click* I assume you are wanting to travel further towards where the storm pushed your precious soul stone?
[OSLO] (Excited Squeak)
[NOREEN] In that case, allow me to offer my assistance, for this area can be vast to the untrained eye. *click* It is cold and desolate but it certainly has a melodic charm if you get my understanding?
[OSLO] (Confused Squeak)
[NOREEN] I apologise. It has been a long time since I have spoken to any creature at all so let me rephrase. *click* As you travel this frozen underwater tundra, you shall find icons of melody which will become your method of escape towards your goal. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[NOREEN] I will warn you though, for whilst there are 3 passages to open, the final is not found down here at all but up in the human built world. *click*  That is an area that not even I can traverse so I am unsure as to the trials and tribulations you will face there. 
[OSLO] (Confused Squeak)
[NOREEN] Alas, I cannot explain anymore as this is your journey to traverse yourself but look out for the musical icons and they will give you the answers to continue on your fated journey. I wish you luck. *click*
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[NOREEN] Before you go, you seem like a soul who could help me. I was given a warmer for my majestic horn from a late dear friend of mine but amidst the storm, I appear to have lost it. *click* If you happen upon it I’d be eternally grateful and would reward you well for its safe return. Please think about it.
