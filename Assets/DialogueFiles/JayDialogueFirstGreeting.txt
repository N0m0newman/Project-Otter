[JAY] Hi little man! What are you doing down here? Came for the vibes?
[OSLO] (Confused Squeak)
[JAY] I know it’s a little vast but all this space? It’s liberating little dude. My names Jay by the way, what's yours?
[OSLO] (Happy squeak)
[JAY] Oslo? Suits you. And you’re searching for a soul stone? That sounds ace my dude. You know, I saw a lot of stuff drop by here not so long ago, it could have been in with all that. 
[OSLO] (Curious Squeak)
[JAY] Yea it was crazy! Did a storm happen up there or something?
[OSLO] (Sad Squeak)
[JAY] Oh no little man. That’s how you lost your stone? Well in that case I’ll give you a tip. There’s an octopus near here who likes to collect anything that look cool. The likelihood is that they have your stone as a finders keepers kind of gig. 
[OSLO] (Angry Squeak)
[JAY] I know little dude but they have a few ways of keeping creatures out. If you’ve got this far though then I’m sure you’ll be able to get through those doors dead easy. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[JAY] There are 4 doors to go through, each with their own puzzles to solve. You look like a pretty smart dude so I’ll just give you the riddle for the first door and I’m sure you’ll figure it out from there. You probably already know how to get through the rest, just keep your eyes peeled for any familiar items. Capiche little man?
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[JAY] I knew you had it. So the riddle is this, It has a body but no limbs, a neck but no head. It’s a mystery but what am I? Best of luck little Oslo, stay safe out there. 
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[JAY] Oh, almost forgot. The octopus took my own lil best friend, the softest mini me you’ll ever find in this abyss and I miss him. If you find him could you bring him back to me? I’d be so thankful little dude. 
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[JAY] Muchos Gracias little fella. Good luck out there.
