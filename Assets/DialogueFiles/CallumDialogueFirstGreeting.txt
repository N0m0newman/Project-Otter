[CALLUM] Howdy there partner! *blub* How goes the day? Almighty monsoon we had back there. Almost destroyed my dear old home. The names Callum if ya wanna know. 
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[CALLUM] Good to meet you Oslo! Can’t say I’ve ever seen any folk like you in these parts before. *blub* What brings you here?
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak)
[CALLUM] Hoowee, that sounds like one doozy of an adventure. *blub* Gotta give it ya Oslo, you’ve got a hell of a journey ahead of ya. All this for a stone?
[OSLO] (Sad Squeak)
[CALLUM] A soul stone. My mistake. Well I gotta respect any creature that cares this much for something so dear. *blub*  I think I’m gonna lend you a hand on your journey. 
[OSLO] (Confused squeak)
[CALLUM] In order to get to the depths below, there’s something you need to know. *blub* You see this coral all around us? Seems pretty damn colourful right?
[OSLO] (Curious Squeak)
[CALLUM] Well there are certain parts that look a little different to the rest. *blub* They look a little out of place one might say. You’ll need to find them and use them to solve the puzzle sitting on the one door between here and the depths. *blub* Ya get me?
[OSLO] (Determined Squeak) 
[CALLUM] In that case I’ll leave ya be but whilst you're searching, *blub*  I used to have a nightlight sitting in my home here until a silly shrimp came and got his damn claws on it. He’s told me he hid it but can’t remember where conveniently in all the madness so if you find it, *blub* I’ll definitely give you something worthy in return. 
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
