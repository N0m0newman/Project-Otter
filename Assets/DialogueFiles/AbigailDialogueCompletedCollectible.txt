[ABIGAIL] Oh amazing! You found my toothbrush? I’m so happy! Now I can finally start getting my teeth back to pearly white again no thanks to those brothers of mine. 
[OSLO] (Happy Squeak)
[ABIGAIL] You’ve made me so happy! Here, have this stone I found whilst playing hide and seek the other day! I hope it brings you as much joy as you’ve brought me!
[OSLO] (Happy squeak)
